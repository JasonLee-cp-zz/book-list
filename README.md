This is book-list app made by **Vanila Javascript** and **Bootstrap**. You can write (title/author/price/book/record URL(blog etc)/ISBN#) to store your book data.



Below is the **front page** where you can enter name. This will be stored in the local Storage so that you can use later after closing tab.

There are some features such as *pop-up message* when you haven't filled out all the input fields.

Also, when you click the **exit** button, all your data in the local storage will be gone and will redirect you to the front page.
